    <h1>Super Easy Roasted Chicken Thighs    </h1>
    <img src = 'upload3.jpg'>
    <h4>This was handed down to me by Mom, a Cincinnati native. Skimming the fat makes this a healthier version than most, and gives it the right consistency. I like mine 4-way, with spaghetti, raw chopped onions, grated mild cheddar, and oyster crackers!
    </h4>
    <h4>Ingredients:-</h4>
        
    <ul>
        <li>5 pounds skin-on chicken thighs
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons adobo seasoning, or to taste   
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon olive oil
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:-</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a rack on a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Place chicken, skin-side down, on the rack. Liberally sprinkle with adobo seasoning. Turn chicken over, brush olive oil on skin, and liberally sprinkle with adobo.
        </li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
