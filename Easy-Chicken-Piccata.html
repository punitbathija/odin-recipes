    <h1>Easy Chicken Piccata</h1>
    <img src = 'upload.jpg'>
    <h4>This is my son's favorite dish. He is a very persnickety eater. Serve this chicken recipe over white rice.</h4>
    <h4>Ingredients:-</h4>
        
    <ul>
        <li>2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts
        </li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>½ stick butter
        </li>
        <li>½ cup white wine
        </li>
        <li>3 medium lemons, juiced
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons drained capers
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:-</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Slice chicken breasts horizontally to yield 4 pieces. Place breasts between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound to 1/4-inch thin. Place flour on a plate and dredge each breast on both sides in flour.
        </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Put chicken into the skillet and season tops with salt and pepper. Turn when nicely browned, about 4 minutes, and season again. Cook second side until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer breasts to a plate, reserving skillet drippings.
        </li>
        <li>Add wine and lemon juice to the skillet, stirring to scrape up any browned bits. Simmer to reduce and thicken sauce, about 5 minutes more. Add capers and pour sauce over chicken breasts on the plate. Sprinkle with parsley.
        </li>
    </ol>
